# Gorillas Game

## Introduction

Gorillas is a modern rendition of the classic 1991 game where two gorillas, perched atop city buildings, take turns hurling explosive bananas at each other. The objective is to accurately aim and hit the opposing gorilla before they hit you. This version is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the HTML Canvas API for rendering.

## Features

-   **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can set the angle and velocity of their throws using intuitive mouse controls.
-   **Dynamic Environment**: Randomly generated city skylines provide a unique experience each game.
-   **Physics-Based Mechanics**: Realistic projectile motion influenced by gravity.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal playability.

## How to Play

1. **Aim**: Click and drag your mouse to set the angle and power of your throw. The direction and length of the drag determine the trajectory.
2. **Throw**: Release the mouse button to launch the banana. The goal is to hit the opposing gorilla.
3. **Turn-Based**: Players alternate turns. The first to successfully hit the other wins the game.
